/* Function Name:
 *      smiRead
 * Description:
 *      Read data from phy register
 * Input:
 *      phyad   - PHY address (0~31)
 *      regad   -  Register address (0 ~31) 
 * Output:
 *      data    -  Register value 
 * Return:
 *      SUCCESS         -  Success
 *      FAILED            -  Failure
 * Note:
 *     This function could read register through MDC/MDIO serial 
 *     interface, and it is platform  related. It use two GPIO pins 
 *     to simulate MDC/MDIO timing. MDC is sourced by the Station Management 
 *     entity to the PHY as the timing reference for transfer of information
 *     on the MDIO signal. MDC is an aperiodic signal that has no maximum high 
 *     or low times. The minimum high and low times for MDC shall be 160 ns each, 
 *     and the minimum period for MDC shall be 400 ns. Obeying frame format defined
 *     by IEEE802.3 standard, you could access Phy registers. If you want to 
 *     port it to other CPU, please modify static functions which are called 
*      by this function.
